# PCA
This directory provides code used to conduct Principal Component Analysis on genotypes of wild chimpanzees generated with a capture array for 85 wild chimpanzees from Cameroon. The PCA plot for neutral SNPs appears in our manuscript, "Environmentally-mediated selection parallels population divergence across a chimpanzee subspecies contact zone" as Figure 1b.
