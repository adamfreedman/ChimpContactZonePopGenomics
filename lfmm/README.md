# Latent Factor Mixed Models (LFMM)
We use LFMM to characterize allele frequency -environment correlations for wild chimpanzee populations in Cameroon. LFFM is a linear modeling framework that explicitly accounts for population structure among sampled populations. This directory contains code used to conduct those analyses and generate figures.
